# A formalization of Lawvere's fixed point theorem

## Main results

The main body of this project is made up of different versions of [Lawvere's fixed point theorem](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lawvere's+fixed+point+theorem) (and their contrapositives):

* The standard theorem for Cartesian closed categories
* The weaker version for point-surjective morphisms instead of weakly point-surjective morphisms
* The "uncurried" version for categories with only finite products
* A non-categorical version formulated only in terms of types
